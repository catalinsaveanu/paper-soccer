                        <h2>Paper Soccer</h2>
                        <p>This is a pencil - and - paper version of the game soccer.Two players compete to get the ball into the opposing player's goal, winning the game. There are two fields per page.</p>
                        <h2>How to play:</h2>
                        <p>The ball starts at the center of the field(marked by a small circle).</p>
                        <p>On your turn, draw a line segment from the ball's current position, along the edge or diagonal of a square to the next intersection. You may not draw along an edge or diagonal that has already been drawn. (You may, however, cross an existing diagonal).</p>
                        <p>If this is the first time the ball has reached that intersection, then the ball stops there, and the next player takes their turn.</p>
                        <p>If the ball has already been at that intersection, then the ball bouncesâ€”you must take another turn, drawing another line.The ball keeps bouncing until it reaches an intersection that it has never been at before.</p>
                        <p>If the ball reaches the opposing player's net, then you score a point.</p>
                        <h2>Special Rules:</h2>
                        <p>When the ball reaches the edge of the field, marked by a heavier line, it always bounces.You may not move along the edge of the field.</p>
                        <p>If you reach a position where you can't make a valid play, then the opposing player wins the game.</p>
